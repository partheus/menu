# Food

## A list of my favorite food places!

# Getting started:
Run the following commands in your local terminal:

    cd my-workspace
    
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/partheus/food.git food-list
    
    cd food-list
    
    npm install

The project is now ready to go live! Run the following command to bring up a local environment with hot reload (any changes you make in the local text editor will reflect immediately in the browser window):

    npm start
    
Open http://localhost:8080 in a browser of your choice. If everything was done right, you should see the homepage of the site! You're now ready to start customizing the site according to your needs! For further help, check out the official 11ty docs here: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/
